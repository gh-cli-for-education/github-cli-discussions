# A call for software contributions to extend gh cli with extensions targeted to teachers using github 

In August 24 2021 [GitHub Cli](https://github.blog/2021-08-24-github-cli-2-0-includes-extensions/) introduced [gh cli extensions](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_extension), allowing anyone to make custom commands that build on the core functionality of [GitHub CLI](https://docs.github.com/en/github-cli).

During the first term of this course 2021/2022 I have been benefitting of [many GitHub Cli extensions written by others](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Agh-extension&type=Repositories&ref=advsearch&l=&l=) and [sometimes by myself](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Agh-extension++user%3Acrguezl+user%3Agh-cli-for-education+language%3AJavaScript&type=Repositories&ref=advsearch&l=JavaScript&l=), that assisted me in my daily teaching work managing the associated GitHub Organizations and GitHub classroom assignments.
 
To foster the writing of gh cli extensions targeted to  teachers I have created a the GitHub Organization called [gh-cli-for-education](https://github.com/gh-cli-for-education). If you are a teacher or a student that uses GitHub, is familiar with GitHub Cli and fell you can help with this goal, please [join the organization! (send me an issue)](https://github.com/gh-cli-for-education/github-cli-discussions/issues/new)  or comment here. 

Looking forward for people that will be willing to lead the way in this direction
